Recently, after a very long time and with great surprise, I found a complete Distro that is well suited to any use, so I kept a Server VM that I use to host some of my Services. In the future (on some spare time) I intend to publish benchmarks made using the Phoronix suite.\nUnlike Linux which uses the ZoL porting of ZFS (not yet perfect), FreeBSD makes use of a native implementation of the ZFS Filesystem - it\u0026rsquo;s a win-win when it comes to storage management. The advantages in it using a filesystem such as ZFS are many and to be taken into consideration for mission-critical systems, resulting in a fairly simple and well documented configuration.\nI was really surprised when I discovered that Netflix used FreeBSD on its proprietary Open Connect platforms to implement its CDN and managing to guarantee an impressive performance (up to 90 Gb / s) on TLS encrypted connections, keeping the CPU at 55% (16 cores at 2.6 Ghz).
