      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take an History lesson and become familiar with the fantastic UNIX universe. Today I would like to talk about BSD and its status in 2019.
The most common BSD distros to date are: FreeBSD - Open BSD - NetBSD
Another interesting project based on FreeBSD is TrueOS.
The main differences between FreeBSD and OpenBSD are notable. The first one tries to develop a complete modern desktop system, facing some common problems that derive from it, the second one is completely focused on security and transparency, as well as being free from non-Open content, which in fact makes it one of the most secure by default distributions in the Open Source panorama.</description>
