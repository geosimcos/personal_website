      <description>This site it&amp;rsquo;s a personal space that I&amp;rsquo;m willing to use for some write-ups and insights of the technologies that I&amp;rsquo;m learning to use and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. Hope to be also useful to some students that are in research of some good materials to study on.
Currently working towards my bachelors in Computer Science.
My studies are focused on Systems Design and Software Engineering. I&amp;rsquo;m fascianated by all the foundations of Computer Science and all the amazing maths work that is driving the Research in the field.</description>
